/**
 * Vehicle.java
 *
 * A class that represents a vehicle.  It is a superclass of all of the
 * other classes that represent vehicles, such as Automobile.
 *
 * Automobile is a subclass of Vehicle.
 *
 * Subclasses of Vehicle are Automobile, Motorcycle, Truck,
 * and their subclasses.
 *
 * We speak of an "is-a relationship": A Motorcycle is-a Vehicle, etc.
 *
 * We also say Vehicle is a base or parent class of the Automobile class.
 *
 * We also say Automobile is a derived or child class of Vehicle.
 *
 * Fields and methods that all vehicles have in common are defined
 * here.  They are inherited by the subclasses of this class.
